1. When processing the [chunked content] response, the logger would print  a note to distinguish chunked content with normal content.
2. If the program failed to get the proxy's socket file descriptor, the mainThread() will throw exception and the program will end. 
3. If the program failed to accept connection on it self,  the mainThread() will throw exception and the program will end. 
4. When the program get a new request, several things would happen:
   4.1 cannot receive response from client/receive 0 bytes: 
    the newThread() would return and would delete the client socket file descriptr and would not have side effects on the main thread
   4.2 when processing GET/POST request:
    failed to get server address
    failed o connect server 
    failed to send request to server
    failed to get response from server
    failed to send responseto client
  4.3 when processing CONNECT request:
    failed to get server address
    failed o connect server 
    failed to send message after setting up the tunnel 
    for the situations in 4.2 and 4.3, the exception would be throw to newThread(), and then the new thread would return and would not effect main thread.
5. the program makes strong guarantee.
